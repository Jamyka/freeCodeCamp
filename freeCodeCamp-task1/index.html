            <h3 id="headline">Here is a brief introduction about this great Professor</h3>
            <p>The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study
            mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King’s College (his college since 1931)
            in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing’s seminal paper “On Computable Numbers, with an
            Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]” was recommended for publication by the American mathematical
            logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing’s, although by
            a different method. Turing’s method (but not so much Church’s) had profound significance for the emerging science of
            computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under
            Church’s direction (completed in 1938).</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Career and Research:</strong> <br> When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by Ludwig Wittgenstein about the foundations of
                mathematics.The lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students,
                from students' notes.Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending formalism and Wittgenstein
                propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths, but rather invents them.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Government apology and pardon:</strong> <br> In August 2009, British programmer John Graham-Cumming started a petition urging the British government to apologise for
                Turing's prosecution as a homosexual.The petition received more than 30,000 signatures.The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, acknowledged the petition, releasing a statement on 10 September 2009 apologising and describing the treatment of Turing as "appalling"</li>
                <li><strong>Awards and tributes:</strong> <br> Turing was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1946.He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951.</li>
                <li><strong>Death:</strong> <br> On 8 June 1954, at his house at 43 Adlington Road, Wilmslow, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day at the age of 41. Cyanide poisoning was established as the cause of death.When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,it was
                speculated that this was the means by which Turing had consumed a fatal dose. An inquest determined that he had
                committed suicide. Andrew Hodges and another biographer, David Leavitt, have both speculated that Turing was re-enacting
                a scene from the Walt Disney film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), his favourite fairy tale. Both men noted that
                (in Leavitt's words) he took "an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the
                poisonous brew".Turing's remains were cremated at Woking Crematorium on 12 June 1954,And his ashes were
                scattered in the gardens of the crematorium, just as his father's had been.</li>
